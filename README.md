I have a BA in Linguistics, Portuguese Language and Education from University of Sao Paulo (USP). 

Although my university education is in another area, my first contact with the development area was when I was 14 years old. 

A basic contact with HTML (markup language) and CSS (styling language). At that time, I was managing a technology, games and news forum (2008-2013). 

The passion for the development area was at second sight.

Because before I chose the area, I taught classes (2016-2018) and also worked with Digital Marketing (2018-2021), where I developed projects in Wordpress.

I really fell in love with the programming field when I studied Computational Linguistics in my last year at university (2021). 

Since February 2022, I'm in training (Full Stack Developer) by Digital House and in partnership with "Globant" and "Mercado Libre". 

So, you can check out some of the projects here.

Once again: welcome!
